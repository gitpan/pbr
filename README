NAME
    pbr - Perl-based Batch Rename

SYNOPSIS
    pbr [-c] [-d *dest_dir*] [-D] [-i] [-l] [-p] [-t] [-v] [-w]
    PerlExpression Files ...

    See below for description of the switches.

DESCRIPTION
    *pbr* is a perl-based batch renaming tool. Normally you wouldn't care
    about the implementation language of a tool, but in this case proper
    usage depends on your knowledge of perl.

    The first argument to this program should be a perl expression that
    modifies $_. The remaining arguments are files that will potentially be
    renamed.

    Each file name is temporarily placed in $_. The given expression is then
    "eval"ed. Only if executing the expression results in the file name
    being changed, is the file renamed accordingly.

    For example, if one of your input file names is "foo.txt" and your
    expression "s/o/O/g", the renamed file will be "fOO.txt".

    On the command line, this would appear as:

       pbr s/o/O/g foo.txt

    If your input file above was "bar.txt", no change or rename would be
    made.
